 Perfect! We have now completed the implementation of the voice chat
  functionality into the existing application. Here's a summary of what
  we've done:

  1. Created the audio recording hook (useAudioRecorder.tsx) to handle
  microphone access and recording
  2. Implemented the AssemblyAI transcription service (transcription.ts)
  to process audio and get real-time transcriptions
  3. Enhanced the multimodal input component to support voice recording
  and transcription
  4. Updated the client file to use the correct environment variable
  5. Made the AI chat component the default page of the application
  6. Added a typecheck script to package.json for better TypeScript
  validation
  7. Updated the application metadata and titles to reflect its purpose

  The voice chat application is now ready to use. Users can:

  1. Click the microphone button to start recording
  2. Speak into their microphone
  3. See their speech transcribed in real-time in the input field
  4. Click the stop button to finish recording
  5. Submit the transcribed text by clicking the send button

  All of this is integrated directly into the main chat interface without
   requiring a separate page.
